Idea:
- web application that will allow users to create, save, and tag notes. Allow users to search by tags.

MVP:
- Users can create and log into their own accounts.
- Users can create notes using a basic in-browser text editor.
- Notes will be saved to the database.
- Users can delete notes.
- Users can update notes.
- All note creations/updates will be logged in an event table, to be used by dev and future features.
- Users can provide custom tags for their notes.
- Notes will automatically be given meta tags (username, timestamp of note, last edited timestamp).
- Users can search by tags. Search will return all notes containing the selected tags.
